# Matrix Multiplication Implementation

**WARNING:** Please ensure you are wearing the right safety equipment before running this code. This is a **VERY FAST** implementation of matrix multiplication.

## About

This project provides a highly optimized implementation of matrix multiplication for ARM. While it offers exceptional performance, the speed and computational intensity can be demanding on your hardware. Winnning implementation of the course Energy Efficient Computing [see here](https://www.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/de/news/matrix-multiply-1300x-faster.html)

## Safety First

We strongly recommend taking the following precautions before using this code:

* **Protective Eyewear:** Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from potential strain.
* **Proper Ventilation:** Ensure your workspace has adequate ventilation to dissipate heat generated by your hardware.
* **Hardware Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools to track your CPU and GPU temperatures during operation.
* **Rest Breaks:** Take regular breaks to avoid eye fatigue and give your hardware a chance to cool down.
