# Matrix Multiplication Implementation

**WARNING:** Please ensure you are wearing the right safety equipment before running this code. This is a **VERY FAST** implementation of matrix multiplication.

## About

This project provides a highly optimized implementation of matrix multiplication for ARM. While it offers exceptional performance, the speed and computational intensity can be demanding on your hardware.

## Safety First

We strongly recommend taking the following precautions before using this code:

* **Protective Eyewear:** Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from potential strain.
* **Proper Ventilation:** Ensure your workspace has adequate ventilation to dissipate heat generated by your hardware.
* **Hardware Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools to track your CPU and GPU temperatures during operation.
* **Rest Breaks:** Take regular breaks to avoid eye fatigue and give your hardware a chance to cool down.
